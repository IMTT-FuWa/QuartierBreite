# Online platform to support neighborhood concepts
The "QuartierBreite" platform was developed specifically for the needs of neighborhoods. It supports the self-organization of the residents in the neighbourhood through networking. The platform is simply structured and specially designed for intergenerational use.

Due to the modular programming method, the range of functions can be adapted to the needs of any neighbourhood. The variant presented here is adapted to the "Breite" quarter of the city of Schaffhausen in Switzerland.

The platform was developed by the [Furtwangen University](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/), funded in the context of several [research projects](https://imtt.hs-furtwangen.de/imtt/wir-im-quartier/).
