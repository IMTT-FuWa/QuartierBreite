## Online platform to support neighborhood concepts
The "QuartierBreite" platform was developed to suit the special needs of urban quarter communities ("Quartiere"). It supports the self-organization of the residents in the neighbourhood through digital networking. The platform is structured in an easy-to-use, straightforward manner and is especially designed for intergenerational use.

Due to the modular programming method, the range of functions can be adapted to the needs of any neighbourhood. The variant presented here is adapted to the "Breite" quarter of the city of Schaffhausen in Switzerland.

The platform was developed by [Furtwangen University](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/) and funded in the context of several [research projects](https://imtt.hs-furtwangen.de/imtt/wir-im-quartier/).
